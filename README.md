# Cedrick Logging - Tech-Stewardship Web Portfolio

A modern web portfolio for **Cedrick Logging** (Owner: Cedrick Thomas), merging Corporate ESG authority with Modern Mass-Timber aesthetics following the "Tech-Timber" design paradigm.

## Design Philosophy

This portfolio implements a "Tech-Stewardship" approach that combines:
- **Corporate ESG Authority**: Trust indicators, certifications (SFI, PEFC, FSC), carbon tracking
- **Modern Mass-Timber Aesthetics**: Clean, sophisticated "Tech-Timber" design (White/Pine/Black palette)
- **Cinematic UX**: Blue sky imagery, horizontal scroll lifecycle, high-end typography
- **Human Trust**: Cedrick Thomas's personal stewardship narrative

## Brand Identity
