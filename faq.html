                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Most forested properties with at least 20 acres of mature timber are suitable for some form of harvest. Key factors include tree species, age (typically 40+ years for softwoods, 60+ for hardwoods), road access, and terrain. We offer free initial consultations to assess your property's potential. Our LiDAR surveys provide precise valuations once you decide to move forward.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We offer several contract types: lump-sum (fixed price for marked timber), pay-as-cut (payment based on actual volume harvested), and share arrangements. Most contracts include provisions for access, liability, site cleanup, and payment schedules. All contracts are reviewed by our legal team and can be customized to your preferences. Typical terms range from 6 months to 2 years depending on the harvest size.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Timeline varies by project size and complexity. A typical 100-acre selective harvest: 2-4 weeks for planning and permitting, 4-8 weeks for harvesting operations, and 2-4 weeks for site restoration. We provide detailed timelines during the planning phase and keep you informed throughout the process via our client portal.</p>

                        <p>Our "Stewards First" philosophy means we leave your property better than we found it. Post-harvest activities include: water bar installation on roads, spreading slash on skid trails, seeding disturbed areas, and our 3-for-1 reforestation program (we plant three seedlings for every tree harvested). Most properties show significant regrowth within 2-3 years.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Payment is based on species, grade, and volume of timber harvested, multiplied by current market prices. Our LiDAR inventory provides accurate pre-harvest estimates. Final payment is calculated using certified scale tickets from the receiving mill. We provide transparent accounting and typically pay within 30 days of delivery.</p>

                    <button class="faq-question">What is LiDAR and why is it better than traditional surveying?</button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) uses laser pulses to create incredibly detailed 3D maps. Unlike traditional ground-based cruising, LiDAR captures data on every tree, provides sub-meter accuracy, and can cover 200+ acres per day. It also penetrates forest canopy to map terrain. This results in 15-25% more accurate volume estimates compared to traditional sampling methods.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Our LiDAR-based inventories typically achieve ±5% accuracy for total volume estimates at the stand level, compared to ±15-20% for traditional cruise methods. Individual tree detection rates exceed 95% for trees over 6" DBH. All estimates are validated against ground-truth plots and historical harvest data.</p>

                        <p>Basic requirements: 40+ acres of contiguous forestland, clear title to the property, forest cover for at least 10 years (no recent deforestation), and willingness to commit to a 20+ year management agreement. Some programs have additional requirements based on location or forest type. We offer a free eligibility assessment.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Earnings vary based on forest type, location, and market conditions. Typical ranges: $15-40 per ton of CO2 sequestered. A well-managed 100-acre forest might sequester 250-400 tons annually, generating $3,750-16,000/year. Our calculator provides personalized estimates based on your specific property characteristics.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, in most programs. "Improved Forest Management" (IFM) projects allow sustainable harvesting as long as overall carbon stocks increase over time. Some programs restrict the intensity or timing of harvests. We help you design management plans that optimize both timber revenue and carbon credit income.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Initial project development takes 6-12 months (baseline inventory, project design, third-party verification). Once verified, credits are issued annually. Payment timing depends on your sales agreement—some buyers pay upfront, others upon credit issuance. We offer advance payment options against future credits for qualified projects.</p>

                        <p>Carbon credit agreements typically transfer with the land. New owners inherit both the benefits (ongoing credit revenue) and obligations (management commitments).
